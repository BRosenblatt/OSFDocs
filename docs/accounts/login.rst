**Purpose:** The login form allows a user to access their existing OSF account.

When signed out, users can login by clicking the “sign in” button at the top right of the page in the :ref:`navigation bar <navigation-bar>`.
Clicking this button opens a dropdown menu with a field for the login email and password. Below the submit (reads “login”)
button, is a link that reads “Forgot Password?”

If the user tries to login via the navigation bar, but enters an unregistered email or an incorrect password, they are
brought to the login page. There, below the password field, an inline red alert reads::

    The email or password you entered is incorrect.

If a logged out user tries to access a :ref:`private <privacy>` OSF project, they are brought to the login
page (accounts.osf.io/login).

The login page asks for their login email and password. A “Forgot Password?” link is available, as well as a link that
reads “Back to OSF” that sends the user to the OSF homepage. A check box that is labeled “Remember me” allows the user
to save their form input so that it appears the next time they visit this page.

If the user tries to log in—on the login page—with a registered (primary or alternate) email and the right password,
they are brought to their dashboard. No alert is shown.

If the user tries to log in—on the login page—with a registered (primary or alternate) email with the wrong password,
an inline red alert is shown on the page. The user is told::

    The email or password you entered is incorrect.

No email is sent.

If the user tries to log in—on the login page—with an unregistered email, an inline red alert is shown on the page. The user is told::

    The email or password you entered is incorrect.

No email is sent.

If the user tries to log in—on the login page—with a deactivated email, they are brought to a page that says in red::

    This account has been disabled. Please contact support@osf.io to regain access.

No email is sent.

If the user tries to log in—on the login page—with an alternate email that has been removed, an inline red alert is shown
on the page. The user is told::

    The email or password you entered is incorrect.

No email is sent.

If the user tries to log in—on the login page—with a deactivated email with the wrong password, an inline red alert is
shown on the page. The user is told::

    The email or password you entered is incorrect.

No email is sent.

Logging in with Two-factor Authentication
------------

**Purpose:** Two-factor authentication provides added security to the user. It requires one additional step to ensure that
the user logging in is, in fact, the account holder.

To log in with two-factor authentication enabled, the user enters their email and password into the empty fields on the
login screen or from the navigation bar. After submitting, the user is asked for a two-factor authentication passcode.
The passcode is accessible via the authenticator (likely `Google Authenticator <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en>`_)
app on their mobile device. Entering the passcode and clicking “Verify” or pressing the return key brings the user to their dashboard.

If the user submits a blank form, a red inline error is shown below the empty passcode field::

    Passcode is a required field.

If the passcode the user enters is incorrect, a red inline error is shown below the empty passcode field::

    The passcode you entered is incorrect.

No log in activity
-----------------

If a user has not signed in to their account in 1 month, they receive the following engagement email::

  Hello <fullname>,
        
          We’ve noticed it’s been a while since you used the Open Science Framework (OSF). We are constantly adding and improving features, so we thought it might be time to check in with you.
          Most researchers begin using the OSF by creating a project to organize their files and notes. Projects are equipped with powerful features to help you manage your research:
              You can keep your work private, or make it public and share it with others
              You can use the wiki to live-edit content with your collaborators
              You can connect to third-party services like Dropbox or Google Drive
          To get started now, visit your dashboard and click on “Create a project.”
          Need help getting started with a project? Check out the <a href="http://help.osf.io">OSF Help Guides</a> or one of our recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGPlVf8FsQ23BehDLFrQa-g">OSF 101 webinars</a>.
          
          Best,
