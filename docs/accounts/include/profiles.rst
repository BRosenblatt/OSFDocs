Public Profiles
***************

**Purpose:**  A user's public profile is a homepage for information about the user and their public OSF projects.

The contents of public profiles are visible to any OSF visitor or user. An OSF user can access their public profile by clicking
on their name in the :ref:`navigation bar <navigation-bar>` or by visiting osf.io/profile. Every user is assigned a
unique URL that can also be used to view their public profile. This URL is listed on the public profile page
below the user's name. Searching the OSF for a user and clicking on their name in the search results will direct you to their profile,
using the unique URL.

All public profiles show the user's name, their sign up date (listed as "Member Since [date]"), their public profile's unique URL,
their public projects and components, as well as their activity points. Optional information includes links to their social
network accounts, their education history, and employment history. These optional fields are shown on the top right of the user's
public profile. They are grouped into tabs; social information is shown by default, employment history is the next tab, and education
history is the final tab.

Social information is listed in rows. The social name (e.g. LinkedIn or Twitter) and logo are listed on the left and a link to the user's profile is on the right.

Employment information is listed in a table. Table headers include "institution/employer," "department/institute,"
"job title," "start date," and "end date." If no employment information is shared, the following message appears when a user clicks the "Employment" tab::
    
    Not provided

A user's public projects and components are displayed at the bottom of the profile page in the following two respective columns::
  
  Public Projects    Public Components

If the user does not have public projects, the following message will appear at the top of the "Public Projects" column::
  
  You have no public projects.
  Find out how to make your projects public [links to the help guides' landing page].
  
If the user does not have public components, the following message will appear at the top of the "Public Components" column::
  
  You have no public components.
  Find out how to make your components public [links to the help guides' landing page].

To edit profile information, users can visit their user "Settings." Alternatively, they can visit their public profile
and then click the "Edit your profile" link. The user is taken to their "Settings" page. The "Settings" page has six pages within it that the user can access using the sidebar. By default, the "Profile Information" page is selected from the sidebar and is shown on the "Settings" page. On the "Public Information" page, the "Name" tab is selected by default.

Usernames
---------

**Purpose:** Configuring their username allows the user to change how they are listed in search results, contributor lists, and in citations.

Several text fields in the "Name" tab on the "Profile Information" allow the user to configure their citation and username preferences. At the bottom of
the page are "Discard changes" and "Save" buttons.

Each time the user clicks **Save**, the "Save" button temporarily changes to "Saving," and then changes back to "Save."

The first field is titled::

    Full name (e.g. Rosalind Elsie Franklin)

This field is automatically filled with the name the user provided when signing up for their OSF account. The user can click inside this field to edit their name.
The maximum character count for the "Full name" field is 186 characters.

If the user deletes the contents from the "Full name" field and clicks **Save**, a black alert appears below the "Full name" field::

    This field is required.

If the user clicks **Save** again, a red alert appears below the previous one::
  
    This field is required.

If the user updates their name and clicks **Save**, a temporary green alert appears below the "Save" button::

    Settings updated

The alert disappears after several seconds.

The "Full Name" field corresponds to the username. After saving changes to this field, to see the username updated on the far right of the navigation bar,
the user must refresh the page. If the username is too long, it will be shortened in the navigation bar by the insertion of an ellipsis so
that the beginning and end of the username are visible, but the middle part of the name is hidden.

Below the "Full name" field is muted text that reads::

    Your full name, above, is the name that will be displayed in your profile. To control the way your name will appear
    in citations, you can use the "Auto-fill" button to automatically infer your first name, last name, etc., or edit
    the fields directly below.
    [Auto-fill]

Below the "Auto-fill" button are the following four fields: "Given name (e.g. Rosalind)," "Middle name(s) (e.g. Elsie)," "Family name" (e.g. Franklin), "Suffix."

Clicking the **Auto-fill** button automatically fills in these fields with the user's full name as provided in the "Full name (e.g. Rosalind Elsie Franklin)" field: The first word from the "Full Name" field is added to
the "Given name" field; the last word is added to the "Family name" field; any interevening words are added to the "Middle name(s)" field; if any recognizable suffixes are listed last in the "Full name" field, such as Jr, Sr, or roman numerals, these will be aded to the "Suffix" field.
Titles are removed. Words entered in quotes are interpreted as nicknames and are removed.

If the user enters their name as "Last name, First name" then the words preceding the comma are entered in as the "Family Name."

The user can edit the four individual name fields (i.e. given, middle, family, and suffix) individually, rather than using the auto-fill function.
To do so, the user clicks inside the field and clicks **Save** to save their changes. These four fields do not affect the username—what is shown in
contributor lists and the navigation bar—but they do affect citations. Any or all of these fields can be left blank.

The maximum character count for the "Given name" field is 256 characters. The maximum character count for the "Middle name" field is 256 characters.
The maximum character count for the "Family name" field is 256 characters. The maximum character count for the "Suffix" field is 256 characters.

As the user updates and saves these fields, the citation preview is updated, indicating what a :ref:`citation <citations>` of their
work will look like. After saving changes to any of these fields, a green alert appears below the "Save" button::

    Settings updated

.. todo:: Report bug: they should be required to have at least a last name.

If the user tries to navigate to another tab within the "Profile Information" page with unsaved changes, a dismissable
red alert appears in the top right of the page::

    There are unsaved changes to your settings.
    Please save or discard your changes before switching tabs.

If the user tries to click to another page, a browser alert appears, requesting confirmation::

    Confirm Navigation
    There are unsaved changes to your settings.
    Are you sure you want to leave this page?
    [Stay on this Page] [Leave this Page]

Clicking "Discard changes" after making changes prompts the following modal to appear::

    Discard changes?
    Are you sure you want to discard your unsaved changes?
    [Cancel][Discard]

Social Information
------------------
**Purpose:** A user's social information can be edited and shared to allow visitors to easily find the user's relevant social media account.

Social information can be edited by visiting the "Social" tab on the "Profile Information" page. There are eight social profiles
that users can connect to their OSF profile: personal site, ORCID, ResearcherID, Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn, ImpactStory, and Google Scholar.

Each option is listed as a header above a text field with example entries entered as placeholder text.

The "Save" button can be pressed any number of times—it is always active.

with no protocol indicated, when they click out of the field the protocol will be automatically added. Entering a domain with no TLD (e.g. .com or .org)

Employment Information

Employment information can be updated by clicking on the "Employment" tab on the "Profile Information" page. By default,
there are empty fields provided for one position. This is indicated by a well labeled "Position 1." The empty fields for the
user to fill in are: "Institution/Employer," "Department/Institute," "Job Title," "Start Date," and "End Date" or "Ongoing." The
"Ongoing" option is a checkbox. Below the "Ongoing" option is a green button labeled "Add another." Below this button are "Cancel" and "Save" buttons.

Clicking the "Add another" button adds new empty fields under the heading "Position 2." When multiple positions are listed,
to the right of the position number are instructions::

    [Drag to reorder]

To the right of this is a red "Remove" link.  Clicking the "Remove" link immediately removes the position and its corresponding
fields.

Users can enter any text into the first three fields of a position—"Institution/Employer," "Department/Institute," and "Job Title." If the user

    Please fill out this field.

they cannot be cleared. If the user attempts to clear the fields and save the empty form, a popover will appear over the
"Institution/Employer" field that reads::

The "Start Date" and "End Date" fields each have a dropdown labeled "--Month--." Each of the months are listed in chronological order. The user
