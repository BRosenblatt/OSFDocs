**Purpose:** A user’s account settings allow them to configure their login and password information, as well as close out
their OSF account.

A user can access their account "Settings" page by clicking their name on the far right of the navigation bar. In the drop-down menu that unfolds, the user clicks **Settings** (with the gear icon to the left of it) and is taken to their account "Settings" page.

Merging Accounts (Connected Emails)
-----------------------------------
**Purpose:** Account merging allows users to consolidate multiple OSF accounts into one and allows the user to login using multiple emails.

Primary and Alternate Emails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Primary emails are the emails to which all correspondence from the OSF will be sent. When merging accounts,
their :doc:`profile information <../profiles/profiles_index>` is kept while the alternate accounts’ is lost.

The user's primary email address is the one they used when signing up for their OSF account. If the user merges an account, the user's primary email address
will be the address they used at the time they merged their account.

An alternate email is another email address or existing account that the user can add to their primary OSF account.

To change a primary email, the user visits Account Settings. An alternate email must exist already—otherwise they must add
an alternate email. The user can click “make primary” next to the alternate email they wish to promote to their primary
email. A green, dismissable growlbox alert appears at the top of the page that reads::

    Made Primary
    [New primary email]

The newly promoted email is then listed under “Primary Email” and the old primary email is moved under “Alternate Emails.”

The user receives an email at their *previous* primary email that reads::

    Hello [User Name],
    I just wanted to let you know, the primary email address for your OSF account has been changed to [New Primary Email].
    If you did not request this action, let us know at contact@cos.io.
    Sincerely yours,
    The OSF Robot

Adding an Alternate Email
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Adding an alternate email initiates the merge process.

Users can merge their accounts by logging into the account they wish to make primary and visiting their Account Settings.
Under “Connected Accounts,” and then "Unconfirmed emails," the user sees the message::

    To merge an existing account with this one or to log in with multiple email addresses, add an alternate email address below.

Following this message is an "i" icon which, when a user mouses over, displays a toolip::
    
    Merging accounts will move all projects and components associated with two emails into one account. All projects and components will be displayed under the email address listed as primary. 

Below the message is a field where the user enters the email address that they want to be their alternate email address under their primary account. The user can then click “Add Email” or hit the return key to initiate the merge process.

Users cannot add the primary email as an alternate email; attempting to do so produces an inline error, below the “Add Email” button::

    Duplicate Email

Clicking “Add Email” before entering text into the address field causes a growlbox to appear below the field::

    Email cannot be empty.

If the user enters text without an @ symbol, a red dismissable error message appears in the top right of the page::

    Error
    Invalid Email

If the user enters an email address with an '@' symbol but no subsequent text, a red dismissable error message appears in the top right of the page::

    Error
    Invalid Email

If the user enters an email address with characters preceding and following an @ symbol, but it is not a valid email address (e.g. includes
no ".com"), after submitting their entry, a red dismissable error message appears in the top right corner of the page::

    Error
    Invalid Email

If the user submits multiple such invalid email addresses, the alerts will stack on top of each other along the right side of the page. The user will need to click the gray "x" icon in the top right of each error message in order to dismiss them.

When the user successfully adds an alternate email, the alternate email appears listed in the “Unconfirmed Emails” section and above the email address field. A modal appears::

    Confirmation email sent
    [Secondary Email] was added to your account. You will receive a confirmation email at [Secondary Email]. Please click the link in your email to confirm this action. You will be required to enter your password. 
    [Close]
    
An email is sent to the alternate email::

    Hello [Primary Account Username],
    This email is to notify you that [Primary Account Email] has an initiated an account merge with your account on the Open
    Science Framework (OSF). This merge will move all of the projects and components associated with [Alternate Email]
    and with [Primary Account Email] into one account. All projects and components will be displayed under [Primary Account Email].
    Both [Primary Account Email] and [Alternate Email] can be used to log into the account. However, [Alternate Email]
    will no longer show up in user search.
    This action is irreversible. To confirm this account merge, click this link: URL.
    If you do not wish to merge these accounts, no action is required on your part. If you have any questions about this
    email, please direct them to support@osf.io.

Clicking on the provided link sends the user to the OSF "Sign In" page (logged in as whichever user was last logged in on that computer). A modal appears upon logging in::

    Merge Accounts
    Would you like to merge [alternate email] into your account? This action is irreverible. 
    [Do not add email][Add email]

Clicking “Add email” sends the user to their dashboard, where a confirmation message appears in the top right of the page::
  
    Success
    [alternate email] has been added to your account.

When the user goes to their “Account Settings” page, their alternate email is listed below the "Alternate Emails" section.

Alternate accounts cannot be merged into the primary account if they have add-ons connected to a project. The Mendeley and
Zotero add-ons are exceptions to this rule, however. If a secondary account has a project with an add-on connected to it
or an add-on token associated with the account, clicking “Confirm Merge” brings the user to a page that reads::

    Cannot Merge Accounts
    Accounts cannot be merged due to a possible conflict with add-ons. Please deactivate any add-ons authorized on the account
    to be merged and try again.

If, when adding an email/account, the user enters an unregistered email into the field, the growlbox alert still shows and
the unregistered email is still listed as an alternate email. The user receives a confirmation email at that unregistered email::

    Hello [Primary Account Username],
    Please confirm your email address by visiting this link:
    URL
    From the Open Science Framework Robot

Clicking the link in the email sends them to their “Account Settings” page where the email is listed as an alternate email.

After adding alternate emails, the user can login to their OSF account with the primary or alternate emails.

The primary account can resend the confirmation email by clicking “resend confirmation” next to the unconfirmed secondary
email. The email is resent but the URL to follow changes. If the user follows the link from the first confirmation email
they were sent, they are sent to a page that reads::

    Invalid Token
    This confirmation link is invalid. Please log in to continue.

If the user makes changes to their alternate account’s projects or profile after the primary account requests the merge,
but prior to the confirmation, those changes are reflected in the merged projects.

If the user merges an account that had an alternate email of its own, both emails are made alternate in the new primary account.

If User A merges with User B and keeps User B's profile and information, User A's GUID and profile will still exist. If a user searches for User B, only one user will show up under User B's name. However, a user can still go to User A's GUID and look at their profile. User A's profile will appear with 0 projects and a banner across the top of hte page pointing to User B's profile::
  
    This account has been merged with [URL of the merged account]

Removing Emails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Unconfirmed and alternate emails can be removed to reduce the number of login emails available.

A primary email cannot be removed. Alternate or unconfirmed emails can be removed by clicking the ‘x’ to the right of the
email address under “Connected Emails” on the Account Settings page. If the user removes an alternate email, a modal appears
asking them to confirm the removal::

    Remove Email?
    Are you sure that you want to remove [unconfirmed/alternate email] from your email list?
    [Cancel][Remove]

Cancelling closes the modal and produces no change. Clicking “Remove” removes the email from the “Unconfirmed Emails” list. A green, dismissable alert appears in the top right of the page::

    Email Removed
    [removed email address]

When an alternate email is removed, both the primary and alternate emails receive an email. The primary reads::
  
    Hello (username),
    
    The email address (user's unconfirmed/alternate email address) has been removed from you account. For security purposes, a copy of this message has also been sent to your account's alternate email address ([user's unconfirmed/alternate email address]). If you did not request this action, let us know at contact@cos.io.
    Sincerely yours,
    The OSF Robot

And the alternate receives::
  
  Hello (username),
  
  The email address (user's unconfirmed/alternate email address) has been removed from you account. For security purposes, a copy of this message has also been sent to your account's primary email address ([user's primary email address]). If you did not request this action, let us know at contact@cos.io.
  Sincerely yours,
  The OSF Robot

After removing an alternate email, no project or profile content changes.

If the user removes an unconfirmed email, a modal appears asking them to confirm the removal::

    Remove Email?
    Are you sure that you want to remove [unconfirmed email] from your email list?
    [Cancel][Remove]

Cancelling closes the modal and produces no change. Clicking “Remove” removes the email from the “Unconfirmed Emails” list.
A green, dismissable alert appears in the top right of the page::

    Email Removed
    [removed email address]

If the user clicks the confirmation link they received in the email after they removed the unconfirmed email address,
they are brought to an error page that reads::

    Bad Token
    The provided token is invalid.

Effects of a Merge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** An account merge should condense OSF content into one account, but remove old user information.

Any projects that were associated with one of the alternate emails are added to :ref:`Project Organizer <organizer>`. If
one of the alternate accounts had collections in the Project Organizer, those are not added to the merged account. The
primary account’s :doc:`User Profile <../profiles/profiles_index>` information is saved while the alternate’s are lost.
Logs from before the merge will show the old user name—if it was different—but contributor lists will show the primary account’s name.

If the user had a different user name for an account that was made alternate, searching the OSF for that old username does
not return the old profile. Similar names may produce relevant results, however.

If the user has two accounts and both are added to a project with different permissions, when the user merges their accounts, the project will reflect the primary account's permissions on the project.

Changing Passwords
------------------

**Purpose:** Passwords can be changed at the user’s request to increase security, make it more memorable, or gain access to the account.

Changing a Password Via Account Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** A user’s account settings can be used to change their password for any reason.

To change a password while logged into the OSF, the user visits their Account Settings. Under “Change Password” there are
three fields: “Old password,” “New password,” and “Confirm new password.” The user completes each field and clicks “Update
password” or presses the return key to confirm the change. The page refreshes and the relevant alert is shown; all fields are empty.

Password test is obfuscated so that the characters appear as dots after the user types them.

If the user does not enter any information into any of the three fields but submits the form, a popover appears under the
“Old password” field that reads::

    ! Please fill out this field

The password is not reset.

If the user enters an incorrect old password but submits the form, the page refreshes and a yellow, dismissable alert
appears at the top of the page::

    Old password is invalid

The password is not reset.

If the user enters a new password and the confirmation password does not match, the page refreshes and a yellow, dismissable
alert appears at the top of the page::

    Password does not match the confirmation.

The password is not reset.

If the user enters the old password as the new password, the page refreshes and a yellow, dismissable alert appears at the top of the page::

    Password cannot be the same.

The password is not reset.

If the new password is less than six characters, the page refreshes and a yellow, dismissable alert appears at the top of the page::

    Password should be at least six characters.

The password is not reset.

If the new password is more than 256 characters, the page refreshes and a yellow, dismissable alert appears at the top of the page::

    Password should not be longer than 256 characters.

The password is not reset.

If more than one of these errors are relevant, they show on separate lines within the same alert.

If the user enters the old password correctly and confirms a new password, the page refreshes and a green dismissable alert
appears at the top of the page::

    Password updated successfully

No email is sent to confirm the change.

The user is able to copy and paste into any of the three fields.

Resetting a Forgotten Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** If a user forgets their password and cannot log in to their OSF account, their password can be reset.

There is no limit to the number of times a user can reset their password.

When attempting to :ref:`log in <login>` from the :ref:`navigation bar <navigation-bar>` or the login page, users
can click on the “Forgot Password?” link. This link directs user to https://osf.io/forgotpassword/. The page is titled
“Password reset request” and there is a field with intructions that read "Enter your email address" into which the user can enter their email address. The user either click the **Reset password** button
or press **enter** on their keyboard to submit the request. A link that reads “Back to OSF” links the user to the OSF homepage.

After the user submits the request, the page will refresh and the user will remain on the "Password reset request" page. A green dismissable alert appears at the top of the page::
  
  If there is an OSF account associated with [email], an email with instructions on how to reset the OSF password has been sent to [email]. If you do
  not receive an email and believe you should have, please contact OSF Support.
  
**Use case: entering an unregistered email**
If a user tries to reset a password for an unregistered email, no email is sent.


**Use case: entering a deactivated email**
If the user tries to reset a password for a deactivated email, a yellow dismissable alert is shown on the page. The user is told::

    An email with instructions on how to reset the password for the account associated with [email] has been sent. If you do
    not receive an email and believe you should have please contact OSF Support.

The user receives an email. They are brought to the reset page. Submitting a new password brings them to a page that says in reads::

    This account has been disabled. Please contact support@osf.io to regain access.

**Use case: resetting a password for an unconfirmed user**

If the user has signed up for an OSF account but has not clicked the link in their account confirmation email to confirm their account, they will be unable to reset their OSF password.

After the user sends a password request, they will receive the following email to reset their password::
  
    Follow this link to reset your password
    [URL]
  
When the user clicks the link in the email, they are brought to the "Reset Password" page. The user is given two fields to enter their new password and verify it. A “Reset Password” button allows them to submit the form.

After the user clicks **Reset Password**, they are taken to the following page::
  
    Open Science Framework
    Sign in with your OSF Account to continue
    Account Not Confirmed
    This login emila has been registed but not
    confirmed. Click here [links to https://osf.io/resend/] to resend your confirmation email.
    [Sign in][Back to OSF]
    [Create Account]
    
When the user clicks **Click here**, they are taken to the "Resend Confirmation Email" page where they can provide the email address they used to create their OSF account to resend themselves an account confirmation email::
  
  Resend Confirmation Email
  Enter your email address and we'll resend your confirmation link.
  [Email address field]
  [Send]
  
See the :ref:`sign_up` for information on how a user can confirm their account.

If the user clicks the confirmation link in the email a second time, they will be taken to the following page::
  
    Invalid Request.
    The requested URL is invalid, has expired, or was already used

**The user has a valid OSF account**
If the user tries to reset a password for a registered email, they receive an email that reads::

    Follow this link to reset your password
    [link]

If the user does not click the link in the email within 15 minutes of receiving it, the link expires. If the user clicks the link, they are taken to the following page::
  
  Invalid Request.
  The requested URL is invalid, has expired, or was already used
  
.. _todo: update the ability to click the link more than once when the Outlook fix goes out.

The link leads the user to a page on the OSF titled “Reset Password.” The user is given two fields to enter their new password
password and to verify that password. A “Reset Password” button allows them to submit the form.

Clicking “Reset Password” without entering anything into either field refreshes the page; a yellow, dismissable alert
appears at the top of the page. It reads::

    Password is required

If the user only fills in the first field but submits the form, a yellow dismissable alert appears at the top of the page. It reads::

    Passwords must match

If the user only fills in the second field but submits the form, two yellow dismissable alerts appear at the top of the page. They read::

    Passwords must match

and::

    Password is required

If the user enters the old password as the new password, the form submits successfully and the user is brought to their Account Settings page.

If the user enters a new password and confirms it, on submission they are brought to their Account Settings page.

If the user follows the link after having already reset the password, they are brought to a page that reads::

    Invalid url.
    The verification key in the URL is invalid or has expired.

If the user enters their email to reset their password, but does not follow the confirmation link, their password remains the same.

Security Settings
-----------------
**Purpose:** Security settings are available to allow the user to configure how much protection they have on their OSF account and data.

Security Settings are found under Account Settings.

Enabling Two-factor Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Two-factor Authentication allows the user to add an additional step to the login process—making it more secure.

To enable Two-factor Authentication, the user visits their Security Settings on their Account Settings page. A description
of two-factor authentication is provided below the title. The user must click the link that reads “Enable Two-Factor
Authentication.” This opens a modal that reads::

    Enable Two-factor Authentication
    Enabling two-factor authentication will not immediately activate this feature for your account. You will need to follow
    the steps that appear below to complete the activation of two-factor authentication for your account.
    [Cancel][Enable]

Clicking “Enable” closes the modal. The “Enable Two-Factor Authentication” link has turned to a red link that reads “Disable
Two-Factor Authentication.” Instructions appear under the Two-Factor Authentication title. Below the verification code field,
a green inline alert reads::

    Successfully enabled two-factor authentication.

The message disappears after a few seconds.

The user must then user their authenticator app on their phone or mobile device to scan the provided QR code or enter the
secret key, written and highlighted in red above the QR code.

The user must then enter their verification code—if they do not, Two-Factor Authentication will not be fully enabled.

The user enters their verification code, provided via their phone, into the field labeled “Enter your verification code:”
and presses “Submit” or hits the return key.

If the verification code that is entered is incorrect, an inline red alert appears below the field that reads::

    Verification failed. Please enter your verification code again.

The message disappears after a few seconds. The incorrect code is still visible in the field.

If the verification code is correct, the page is refreshed and the instructions are removed—only the option to disable
Two-Factor Authentication is still visible.

If the user disables Two-factor Authentication but then re-enables it, they must set up a new authenticator on their phone
(i.e. they must rescan the QR code or re-enter the secret key into their phone). If they do not do so, the verification
code will not be correct.

Disabling Two-Factor Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Disabling Two-Factor Authentication allows the user to remove the second step of the login process that they
had previously enabled.

To disable Two-Factor Authentication, the user must visit their Security Settings. Next to the title for “Two-factor
Authentication” is a red link that reads “Disable Two-Factor Authentication.” Clicking this link pulls up a modal that reads::

    Disable Two-factor Authentication
    Are you sure you want to disable two-factor authentication?
    [Cancel][Disable]

Clicking “Disable” turns the red disable link into a blue link that reads “Enable Two-Factor Authentication.” A description
of two-factor authentication is provided below the title.

After disabling Two-Factor Authentication, the user can login without the extra verification step.

Export Account Data
-------------------
**Purpose:** Some users may wish to leave the OSF or to have an additional copy of their OSF content; in these events,
exporting account data allows the user to get a copy of the contents of their entire OSF account.

To export a user’s account data, the user must visit their Account Settings and scroll to “Export Account Data.” A
description of the service is above a button titled “Request Export.”

Clicking “Request Export” brings up a modal that reads::

    Request account export?
    Are you sure you want to request account export?
    [Cancel][Request]

After clicking “Request,” a green dismissible growlbox alert appears at the top of the page that reads::

    Success
    An OSF administrator will contact you shortly to confirm your export request.

The request is sent to support@osf.io and administrators contact the user via email.

The “Request Export” button becomes disabled, but is re-enabled on refresh.

Deactivating an Account
-----------------------
**Purpose:** Users should be able to make an OSF account and ostensibly remove the desired content from the OSF.

Users can deactivate their account by visiting their "Account Settings" and scrolling down to the "Deactivate Account" section of the page. This section has an overview of what account deactivation entails as well as a yellow warning, both of which read::

    Warning: Once your deactivation has been approved the effects are irreversible.
    
    Deactivating your account will remove you from all public projects to which you are a contributor. Your account will no longer be associated with OSF projects, and your work on the OSF will be inaccessible.
    [Request deactivation]

To deactivate their account, the user will need to click the red “Request deactivation” button. After clicking the “Request deactivation” button, a modal will appear asking the user to confirm whether they want to deactivate their account::

    Request account deactivation?
    Are you sure you want to request account deactivation? An OSF administrator will review your request. If accepted,
    you will NOT be able to reactivate your account.
    [Cancel][Request]

Clicking the “Request” button submits the request, and a green, dismissible notification will appear in the top right of the page::

    Success
    An OSF administrator will contact you shortly to confirm your deactivation request.

An email is sent to support@osf.io listing the OSF user’s GUID, profile URL, and their primary email address. The “Request deactivation” button
is disabled. After a deactivation request is sent, a green "Cancel deactivation request" replaces the red "Request deactivation" button. Above this button is the following message::
  
    Your account is currently pending deactivation. 

This message persists until the account is deactivated. When a deactivation request is sent, a team evaluates the situation before communicating with the user.

The user can click the button to cancel their account deactivation at any time until their account is deactivated. Clicking **Cancel deactivation request** brings up the following confirmation modal::
  
    Cancel deactivation request?
    Are you sure you want to rescind your account deactivation request? This will preserve your account status.
    [Cancel][Cancel Deactivation Request]
    
Clicking **Cancel** retains the deactivation request and closes the modal. Clicking **Cancel Deactivation Request** cancels the deactivation request, and a green, dismissable confirmation message will appear in the top right of the page::
  
    Success
    An OSF account is no longer up for review.

The red "Request deactivation" button is restored on the "Account settings" page.
    
Deactivating an account: no projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the user does not have projects on the OSF, the contact will email the user, explaining what will happen to their account upon deactivation and asking them to confirm deactivation. The contact uses an email macro called "Acct Deactivation - No projects" that reads as follows::
  
    Hello,
    I am writing to confirm that you wish to deactivate your account on the Open Science Framework (OSF). If you have initiated this request and wish to deactivate your account, please respond to this email and confirm. If you have NOT initiated this request, or initiated this request in error, please respond and let us know. If you take no action, your account will not be deactivated. 
    Thanks, 
    
If the user does not want to deactivate their account, the contact will not take any action, and the user's OSF account will remain.

If the user confirms deactivation, the contact will deactivate the user's account.


Deactivating an account: private projects - sole contributor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the user has projects that are all private and on which they are the only contributor, the contact will email the user explaining what will happen to their account upon deactivation and asking them to confirm deactivation. The contact uses an email macro called "Acct Deactivation - Private and sole contrib" that reads as follows::
  
  Hello,
  I am writing to confirm that you wish to deactivate your account on the Open Science Framework (OSF). As your only projects on the OSF are private and do not share other contributors, we will delete their contents upon deactivation of your account.

If you have initiated this request and wish to deactivate your account, please respond to this email and confirm. If you have NOT initiated this request, or initiated this request in error, please respond and let us know. If you take no action, your account will not be deactivated. 
  Thanks, 

If the user does not want to deactivate their account, the contact will not take any action, and the user's OSF account will remain.

If the user confirms deactivation, the contact will deactivate the user's account.

Deactivating an account: private projects with other contributors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the user has all private projects and some or all have other contributors, the contact will email the the user explaining what will happen to their account upon deactivationand asking them to confirm deactivation. The contact uses an email macro called "Acct Deactivation - Private and other contribs" that reads as follows::
  
  Hello,
  This email is to confirm a deactivation request for your account on the Open Science Framework. Your project(s) on the OSF are private and have other contributors associated with them. If you’d like to remain listed on the project(s), we will show you as a non-claimed contributor (meaning your name will be attached, but you will not have an account). If you do not want your name associated with the project(s), please remove yourself from them prior to confirming deactivation. If you have requested this action and would like your account deactivated, please reply and confirm. If you do not reply to confirm, no action will be taken.
  Best,

If the user does not want to deactivate their account, the contact will not take any action, and the user's OSF account will remain.

If the user confirms deactivation, the contact will deactivate the user's account.

Deactivating an account: public projects and sole contributor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the user has public projects on which they are the only contributor, the contact will email the user explaining what will happen to their account upon deactication and asking them to confirm deactivation. The contact uses an email macro called "Acct Deactivation - Public and sole contrib" that reads as follows::

  Hello,
  This email is to confirm a deactivation request for your account on the Open Science Framework. Your projects on the OSF are public, and you are the only contributor. If you would like to delete the projects, please do so before confirming your deactivation request.

If you have requested this action and would like your account deactivated, please reply and confirm. If you do not reply to confirm, no action will be taken.
  Best,

If the user does not want to deactivate their account, the contact will not take any action, and the user's OSF account will remain.

If the user confirms deactivation, the contact will deactivate the user's account.

Deactivating an account: public projects with other contributors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the user has public projects and some or all have other contributors, the contact will email the user explaining what will happen to their account upon deactivation and asking them to confirm deactivation. The contact uses an email macro called "Acct Deactivation - Public and other contribs" that reads as follows::

  Hello,
  This email is to confirm a deactivation request for your account on the Open Science Framework. Your project(s) on the OSF are public and have other contributors associated with them. If you’d like to remain listed on the project(s), we will show you as a non-claimed contributor (meaning your name will be attached, but you will not have an account). If you do not want your name associated with the project(s), please remove yourself from them prior to confirming deactivation. If you have requested this action and would like your account deactivated, please reply and confirm. If you do not reply to confirm, no action will be taken.
  Best,

If the user does not want to deactivate their account, the contact will not take any action, and the user's OSF account will remain.

If the user confirms deactivation, the contact will deactivate the user's account.

User tries to reclaim their account on a project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the user is still listed on a public project, their name will not be hyperlinked to an OSF account but will be plain black text. If the user hovers over their name, the following tooltip will appear::
  
    Is this you? Click to claim

If the user goes to claim their account, the following textbox will appear::
  
    Claim Account
    [textbox to enter an email address]

If the user enters their email address into the textbox and clicks the green checkmark to submit their request to claim their account, the textbox becomes outlined in red and the following red dismissable alert appears in the top right of the page::
  
    Unable to resolve
