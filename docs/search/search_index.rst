Searching the OSF
================

**Purpose:** The search bar allows users to find relevant content on the OSF or SHARE.

.. todo:: Add SHARE docs

The search bar is accessible via a magnifying glass link on the :doc:`navigation bar <../navigation/navigation>`.
The search bar stretches the width of the page and is attached below the navigation bar. Users can type in their query
using `Lucene search syntax <http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Search+Application+Query+Syntax>`_
and hit “return” on their keyboard.

To the right of the search field is a question mark icon. Clicking the question mark brings up a modal that reads::

    Queries
    Search uses the Lucene search syntax. This gives you many options, but can be very simple as well. Examples of valid searches include:
        repro*
        brian AND title:many
        tags:(psychology)

To the right of the question mark icon is an ‘x.’ Clicking the ‘x’ closes the search bar.

Upon submitting a query, the user is brought to the search results page. The search bar can not be closed on the search
page, but a new query can be submitted.
