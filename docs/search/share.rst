**Purpose:** Aggregates data from several different sources to make research easily searchable and accessible.

The user can navigate to SHARE either by searching the OSF or by going to `<http://www.share.osf.io/>`_. When the user goes directly to share.osf.io, they are taken to the SHARE landing page.

Searching from the OSF
----------------------
**Purpose**: Takes the user to `<http://www.share.osf.io/>`_ 

When the user searches the OSF, and clicks **SHARE** from the left sidebar, they are taken to the SHARE "Discover" page that shows results pertaining to the query that the user entered into the OSF search bar.

The SHARE Landing Page
----------------------
**Purpose**: Allows users to search for content in SHARE by either using the search bar or adding filters.

The SHARE landing page is the main place from which the user can search SHARE.

There is a gray navigation bar at the top of the page. When the user scrolls down the page, the navigation bar does not stick to the top. The user needs to scroll back up to the top of the page in order to access the navigation bar.

On the left side of the navigation bar is the word "SHARE" and its logo. Clicking **SHARE** takes the user to the OSF SHARE landing page.

On the right side of the navigation bar are three buttons::
  
  Discover | FAQ | [username]

Clicking **Discover** takes the user to the "Discover" page where they can search SHARE. 

Clicking **FAQ** takes the user to the SHARE "Frequently Asked Questions" OSF component that houses the SHARE FAQs (https://osf.io/cpsin/). 

Clicking the username in the far right of the navigation bar prompts a drop-down menu to appear with the following options: "My Profile" and "Log out." When the user clicks **My Profile**, they are taken to their SHARE profile page. When the user clicks **Log out**, they are taken to the SHARE landing page where, instead of seeing their username in the top right of the page, they see a light blue "Sign in with OSF" button. When the user clicks **Sign in with OSF**, they are taken to the :ref:`OSF "Sign in" page <login>` where they can sign in to SHARE using their OSF username and password.

The search bar appears with text that reads: "Search scholarly works." The user can type in a query and search - either by clicking the magnifying glass icon to the right of the search bar or pressing **enter** on their keyboard. Below the search bar is a linked "Advanced Search" button that, when clicked, takes the user to the "Discover" page from which the user can choose filters to apply to their search.

Below the "Advanced Search" button on the landing page are the following three buttons representing filters: Publications, Preprints, and Sources. 

When the user clicks "Publications" and "Preprints," they are taken to the "Discover" page where search results relevant to the respective filter appear. 

When the user clicks "Sources," They are brought to a page that lists all of the sources on SHARE. The user can click a source from this list, and they will be taken to the "Discover" page where search results relevant to the source will appear.

Below these three buttons on the landing page is the following text::
