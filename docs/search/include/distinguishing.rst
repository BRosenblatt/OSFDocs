Distinguishing Search Results
*****************************

**Purpose:** Results returned include projects, components, users, registrations, preprints, files, institutions, and SHARE results. Each is distinguished
from one another so that the user can best find the appropriate resource.

Project and component results show the title with a link to the "Overview" page as well as the contributors and links to
their user profiles. If tags or descriptions are provided, these are listed below the project title. Options to jump to
the homepage wiki or the files page are provided.

If a returned result is a component, the parent project title precedes the component title using the standard breadcrumbs
format: Project / Component. Both the project and component titles are linked to their corresponding "Overview" pages. If a parent project is private, and its component is public, the project hierarchy will be hidden in search results.

Registration results also show the title and contributors with links to the registration’s "Overview" page and user profiles.
In addition, registrations are indicated by text to the right of their name that reads “(Registration).” Below the title
of the registration is bold text that reads::

    Date Registered: [Date and time]

User results show the user’s name and their Gravatar image.

SHARE results are not shown, but are accessible via the SHARE link (filter) on the left hand side of the page.

If no search results are returned, the right side of the page shows “No results found” and the category filters only
show the Total and SHARE categories, with a count of zero relevant results.

Filtering Search Results
------------------------
**Purpose:** Filtering allows the user to remove extraneous results.

Filtering by Category
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Filtering by category allows users to focus their search on the correct content type.

When performing a search, there is a left sidebar that shows categories and their counts of how many results fell into each category. The categories are: Projects, Components, Users, Registrations, Preprints, Files, Institutions, and SHARE. A Total category is shown at the top of the sidebar. The sum of the categories amounts to the Total.

By default, the Total results are selected and displayed. The categories are displayed below the Total category in the order from most to least results. If a category has no results, it does not appear in the sidebar.

Selecting the "Preprints" and "Institutions" filters takes the user to the respective search pages for that product. For preprints, the search query parameter is carried over to the OSF Preprints "Discover" page, and filtered results will appear. For institutions, the search query parameter is not carried over, and the user is simply taken to the OSF Institutions search page.

Links from each search result take the user to the respective page. For example, selecting an institution from the search results will take the user to that institution's landing page, and selecting a preprint will take the user to the preprint "Detail" page.

Clicking on the SHARE category from the sidebar takes the user to the SHARE search page with the search query parameter. SHARE results do not contribute to the Total category result count.

Users can select one of the other categories by clicking on its title. Only search results that fall into that category
are then shown on the right hand side of the page. Only one category can be selected at a time.

Filtering by Tag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Filtering by tag narrows the search frame and raises the topic relevance of results.

When performing a search, below the left sidebar of categories are a list of tags that the search results are associated with. This section of tags is titled "Improve your search." "If no tags
are associated with any of the results, no tags appear. Clicking through each category displays the same tags.

Tags are ordered by the number of their results. They appear as buttons with a blue/grey background. The tag that has been
used the most among the search results appears first in the list.

Users can click on a tag to filter the search results. When a tag is selected, the search bar appends “AND tags:("XXX")” to the end of the query. Multiple tags can be selected and appended to a query. Tags cannot be unselected, but the user can manually delete the tag filter from the search bar (i.e. the user can delete “AND tags:("XXX").”

Filtering by license
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose**: Filtering by license narrows the search results to show those items with a particular license.

The "Filter by licence" sidebar is only visible when the user clicks the "Projects," "Components," or "Registrations" categories from the left sidebar. The list of filters appears below the "Improve your search" section of licenses. Each license type has a number to its right that shows how many search results are associated with that license. Licenses are ordered from top to bottom according to the total number of search results associated with that license. Even if no search results have added a licence, the license type has the number "0" to its right. The user can select one license to filter search results. Or, the user can select multiple licenses at the same time to filter search results - each selected licence will be highlighted in blue in the left sidebar.
