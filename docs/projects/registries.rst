**Purpose:** OSF Registries allows users to search for public registrations.

OSF Registries is powered by SHARE. On the OSF Registries landing page, the user can search for registrations by typing a query into the search box or by clicking a registration in the "Browse Recent Registrations section."

When the user clicks a registration below the "Browse Recent Registrations section," they are taken to the registration form for that registration. 

When the user types a query into the search box on the landing page, search results relevant to that query will appear.

To search by registration titles, the user can simply enter the title into the search box and press **enter** on their keyboard or click the **search** button. To search by author(s) or keyword(s), the user should use the boolean operators *AND* and *OR*. To refine a search with boolean operators, the user should type any of the following syntaxes:

**SEARCH BY AUTHOR**
* author:(albert einstein)

* author: “albert einstein”

* author: ‘albert einstein’

* authors:(nosek AND spies)

* authors: “nosek AND spies”

* authors:’nosek AND spies’

**SEARCH BY KEYWORD**

* tags:”multimedia”

* tags:(multimedia)

* tags: ‘multimedia’

* tags:”computer AND science”

* tags:(computer AND science)

* tags:’computer AND science’

* tags:”psychology OR neuroscience”

* tags:(psychology OR neuroscience)

* tags:’psychology OR neuroscience’

On the OSF Registries search page, there are two left sidebars with filters by which the user can refine their search:

* a "Provider" sidebar that shows all of the registration providers that OSF Registries aggregates
* an "OSF Registration Type" sidebar that shows all of the registration types that the OSF offers. 

The user can select a registration provider to search for registrations posted to a specific provider.

The "OSF Registration Type" sidebar will be disabled, and will become activatead if select (only) **OSF Registries** from the "Provider" sidebar. When the sidebar is disabled, a red alertis displayed above it::
  
    Only available with OSF Registries

If the user selects **OSF Registries** and any additional providers, the "OSF Registration Type" sidebar will be disabled. 

When the user selects **OSF Registries**, the red alert disappears and the sidebar becomes available. The user can check the boxes next to the registration types by which they want to filter search results. Checking the boxes will show the public registrations that are of those registration types. The registration types available are::
  
    AsPredicted Preregistration
    Election Research Preacceptance Competition
    OSF-Standard Pre-Data Collection Registration
    Open-Ended Registration
    Pre-Registration in Social Psychology (van 't Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016): Pre-registration
    Prereg Challenge
    Registered Report Protocol Preregistration
    Replication Recipe (Brandt et al., 2013): Post-Completion
    Replication Recipe (Brandt et al., 2013): Pre-Registration

Registration search results display the registration title first, followed by the author(s), description, provider, date the project was registered, links, and the date on which the registration was added.
