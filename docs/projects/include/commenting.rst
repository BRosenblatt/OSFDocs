**Purpose:** Commenting allows contributors on private projects and OSF users on public projects - when allowed by the project administrator(s) - to discuss the project's contents. 

When a user has commenting permissions, a blue chat icon will appear along the project banner in the top right.
Clicking the icon will open a Comments panel. The project title appears at top of the panel followed by a textbox to add a comment.
Comments are ordered top to bottom from most recent to least recent. 

At the top of the Comments panel is textbox. The filler text reads::
  
    Add a comment

To leave a comment, the user types into the textbox. There is a 1000-character limit per comment. When adding a comment, a character count shows in the bottom right of the box::
  
    x/1000

The character count, "x" increases as the user types. Below the texbox are "Cancel" and "Comment" buttons Clicking **Cancel**
clears the textbox. Clicking **Comment** posts the comment to the Comments panel. The "Comment" text on the button temporarily
changes to "Commenting" as the comment is being posted.

Comments appear with the commentor's name as well as how long ago the comment was made. Three icons allow interaction with
a commentor's own comment after posting. The pencil icon allows the user the edit their comment. The arrow icon allows the user
to reply to the comment. The trash can icon allows the user to delete the comment. Comments by other users appear with the arrow
icon for replying and the triangular warning icon for reporting spam or abuse. 

When a user reports a comment, they are prompted to mark it as "Spam or advertising," "Hate speech," or "Violence or harmful behavior."
An optional textbox allows them to describe the abuse further, followed by [Cancel] and [Report] buttons. Reporting a comment hides it
from the reporter and instead shows text saying "Comment reported." and "Not abuse." Other users can still see the comment. Selecting
"Not abuse" will regenerate the comment for the reporter. Replies to a comment are visible regardless of the parent comment's visibility. 

Deleting a comment replaces the comment with text saying "Comment deleted." and "Restore." Selecting "Restore" will reinstate the orginal
comment. Only the original commentor may delete their own comment and reinstate it. 

The user can address a comment to a contributor by typing "@" followed by the contributor's name. Typing "@" prompts a drop-down menu to
appear where the user can select any of the names of the project's contributors. The mentioned contributor will receive an email notifying
them that they have been addressed in a comment. Comments with replies appear with a plus icon on the right side of the comment. Clicking the
plus icon expands the comment thread and causes the plus icon to change to a minus icon. Likewise, clicking the minus icon collapses the comment
thread and causes the minus icon to change back to the plus icon.
