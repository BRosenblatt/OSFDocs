Components
**********

**Purpose:** Components allow users to break up their research into relevant elements.

A component is a piece of a project, typically comprised of thematically related files or information.

Components have their own contributors, privacy, files, wikis, and other settings.

When a new component is created from the :ref:` Components widget <component-widget>`, the user is brought into the new component.
A dismissable blue alert is shown at the top of the page::

    Your component was created successfully. You can keep working on the component page below or return to the project page.

Components display their title in the same place on the Overview that projects do. Their titles are displayed as "[Parent Project
Title] / [Component Title]." The parent project's title is a link to the parent project. Users can also navigate to the parent
project by clicking the up arrow in the grey navigation bar.
