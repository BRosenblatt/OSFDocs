Public Content on the OSF
*************************

**Purpose:** The OSF is a repository and project management tool that allows users to make their content publicly available.
Public projects are shared in order to increase access to scientific knowledge.

Individual users with administrative :ref:`permissions <contributors>` on a project have the ability to make
the project :ref:`public <privacy>`, adding it to the public content on the OSF. Projects can be returned to private.

This content is accessible by searching the OSF, following links to public projects, or by visiting the :ref:`Public Activity page <public-activity>`.

:ref:`User profiles <profiles>` are public content as well and can be viewed by any OSF user or visitor.
