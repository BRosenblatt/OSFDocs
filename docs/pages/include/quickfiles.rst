**Purpose**: To allow users to upload public files quickly and independently from projects.

Every user has their own Quick Files page and can be found in the :ref:`OSF navigation bar <navigation>` as the "My Quick Files" tab. Clicking this tab takes the user to a list where they can upload and access their quick files.

The "Quick Files" page is in table format, with the following columns of metadata::

    Name | Size | Version | Downloads | Modified
    
The modified date is in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD 00:00 AM/PM.

All quick files can be viewed on their respective "File Detail" page. If a user has uploaded quick files, their quick files will be listed on their OSF profile page. If the user has not uploaded files to Quick Files, this section will not appear on their profile page. Quick files appear in the main OSF search under "Files" with the following source::
  
    From: <username's> Quick Files

Uploading Quick Files
---------------------

When the Quick Files page is empty, an upload zone appears in place of the file's table with the following helper text::
  
    Drop files here to upload

The user can drag and drop files into the upload zone. Only single file uploads are supported. If dragging and dropping more than one file into the upload zone, a red dismissable progress bar/error message appears in the top right of the page::
  
    Cannot upload multiple files

The user can also click the **Upload** button in the toolbar to select a file from a dialog box. Only one file can be selected for upload at a time.

Once a file is uploaded, a temporary confirmation message appears above the files list::
  
    This file has been added

A progress bar appears in the top right of the page with the following title::
    
    A file has been added

    [Cancel][Back][Move file]

The "Move file" button is disabled until the user enters text into the "Title" field. If the user enters a title, and navigates away from the "Quick Files" page, the project will not be created and the file will remain in "Quick Files. Clicking the **Cancel** button cancels the action and closes the modal.

    [Keep working here][Go to new project]
      
Clicking **Keep working here** closes the modal and keeps the user on their "Quick Files" page. Clicking outside the modal (without clicking a button) also closes the modal and keeps the user on the page. Clicking **Go to new project** takes the user to the new project.

Clicking the **Connect file to existing OSF project** button changes the modal screen to initiate the process of moving a file to an existing project.
