Clicking **OSF Home** > **OSF Institutions** in the navigation bar takes the user to the "OSF Institutions" landing page at https://osf.io/institutions/. The "Home" button defaults to "OSF Institutions" upon navigating to the page.

The landing page is branded::
  
    OSFINSTITUTIONS
    OSF Institutions is a free scholarly web tool that enhances transparency, fosters collaboration, and increases the visibility of research outputs at the institutional level. Read more <https://cos.io/our-products/osf-institutions/>
    
A list of institutions appears down the page. Each institution is represented by the institutional name and logo. The user can filter the list by typing in the name or sorting alphabetically. If filtering by a name that does not exist, no results will appear in the list.

Selecting an institution from the list takes the user to the institutional landing page for that institution.

Instructions for setting up an institutional landing page appear below the list::
