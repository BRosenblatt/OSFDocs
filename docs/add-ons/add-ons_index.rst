.. _add-ons:

Add-Ons
==========
**Purpose:** Add-ons can be used to connect a third party service to the OSF. This increases the amount of storage the user
can make use of via the OSF.

For information on linking an OSF account to an add-on, visit :ref:`User Level Add-on Settings <user-addon>`

Include linking to add-on, overview widget, files browser behavior, file detail page.


Dataverse: if they have multiple linked to their user profile then when the connect the account they can choose from a dropdown (if they don't have multiple connected...)


Amazon S3: https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io/pull/3363
https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io/pull/3812

Google Drive: https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io/issues/3748

Mendeley: https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io/pull/3900



Users with administrative and read+write privileges can connect and configure storage add-ons from their :ref:`Settings page <settings>`.
To do this from the main project page, users can click the “Settings” button in the grey navigation bar. For users
with read only privileges, the “Settings” button will be visible, but options to connect and configure add-ons will
not be available. Visitors to a project (i.e. those who are not contributors on a project) will not see the “Settings”
button and will not be able to connect and configure add-ons.


To configure any add-on, the first step is to visit the Settings page and check the corresponding box under "Select Add-ons."

.. _s3:

Configuring Amazon S3
**********
**Purpose:** Connecting to Amazon S3 allows users to create a two way connection between the OSF and Amazon S3.

Users who choose to connect their Amazon S3 account to the OSF can check appropriate box. They are presented with a
modal::

    Amazon S3 Add-on Terms
    Function | Status

    Permissions: Making an OSF project public or private is independent of making an S3 bucket public or private. The
    OSF does not alter the permissions of linked S3 buckets.
    View / download file versions: The S3 add-on supports file versions if versioning is enabled for your S3 buckets.
    Add / update files: Adding/updating files in the project via OSF will be reflected in Amazon S3.
    Delete files: Files deleted via OSF will be deleted in Amazon S3.
    Logs: The OSF keeps track of changes you make to your S3 buckets through the OSF, but not for changes made using S3 directly.
    Forking: Forking a project or component does not copy S3 authorization unless the user forking the project is the
    same user who authorized the S3 add-on in the source project being forked.
    Registering: S3 content will be registered, but version history will not be copied to the registration.

    This add-on connects your OSF project to an external service. Use of this service is bound by its terms and conditions.
    The OSF is not responsible for the service or for your use thereof.
    This add-on allows you to store files using an external service. Files added to this add-on are not stored within the OSF.
    [Cancel][Confirm]

On this modal, users can click “Cancel” to cancel this action and close the window or “Confirm” to continue configuring Box.

If user clicks “Confirm” but does not click “Apply,” and navigates away from page, a browser popup appears asking user to
confirm navigation away from the page because pending add-on changes were not saved.

After confirming, users will see a green “Apply” button appear at the bottom of the Select Add-ons panel. Clicking “Apply”
will apply the settings. Green inline text appears for a few seconds below the "Apply" button::

    Settings updated

If the user has not connected Amazon S3 to their profile before, the Amazon S3 panel will then show two text fields
labeled "Access Key" and "Secret Key." The user must enter the keys and click "Save."

If the entered keys are incorrect, red inline text appears below the "Save" button::

    Unable to list buckets. Listing buckets is required permission that can be changed via IAM

If one field is left blank, red inline text appears below the "Save button::

    All the fields above are required.

After entering correct information, green inline text appears::

    Successfully added S3 credentials.

If the user has connected to Amazon S3 previously, there are no text fields but there is a blue "Import Account from Profile"
link to the right of the section title. Clicking the link opens a modal::

    Import S3 credentials?
    Are you sure you want to authorize this project with your S3 credentials?
    [Cancel][Import]

Importing refreshes the page. Green inline success text is shown in the Amazon S3 section::

    Successfully imported S3 credentials.

Below the Amazon S3 title row is now bold text that reads "Current Folder: None." This is updated when the user selects
a folder. A blue button labeled "Change" is below the "Current Folder" text. Clicking this button expands and collapses
a dropdown below. An additional button to the right of "Change" is labeled "Create Bucket."

In the dropdown are all of the user's Amazon S3 buckets. After selecting one, the user must save their changes. Leaving the page without
saving produces no warning and will not enact the changes.

Amazon's rules for bucket naming are evolving. It is possible that a previously-created bucket will violate updated bucket naming conventions. As the US East (Northern VA) region for storage was the first location, the rules for bucket naming there are more lax than other storage locations. The laxer rules allow bucket names up to 255 characters long, consisting of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, periods, hyphens, and underscores. If a user attempts to connect a bucket that violates this, they will receive an error message that the bucket must follow the stricter naming conventions (though this should not be possible). See section about creating buckets (below) about bucket naming conventions.

Alternative to selecting an existing repo, the user can create a new one by clicking "Create Repo." This opens a modal::

    Bucket Name [text field]
    Bucket Location [dropdown]
    [Cancel][Create]

If the user saves an empty name field, the modal is closed and red inline text below the dropdown reads::

    Bucket name cannot be empty

Bucket names must follow Amazon's guidelines (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html#bucketnamingrules): Bucket names should look like subdomains, one or more labels joined with periods. A label consists of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. The first and last character of a label may not be a hyphen. The bucket name must be between 3 and 63 characters long. Any character besides those are invalid.    

The "Bucket Location" field allows the user to select the server location where they wish to store their data. "US
Standard" is selected by default.

If the user correctly creates a new bucket, it becomes the choice selected in the dropdown and green inline text appears below::

    Successfully created bucket "[bucket name]". You can now select it from the drop down list.

Clicking "Save" produces green inline text below the dropdown::

    Successfully linked S3 bucket "[bucket name]". Go to the Files page to view your content.

Clicking "Save" without making changes produces no effect.

To disconnect Amazon S3, the user clicks the red "Disconnect Account" link. This opens a modal::

    Disconnect S3 Account?
    Are you sure you want to remove this S3 account?
    [Cancel][Disconnect]

Clicking "Disconnect" removes the dropdown and connected repo information. The "Disconnect Account" link is replaced by a link
that reads "Import Account from Profile." Alternatively, the user can uncheck the add-on from the "Select Add-ons" list and save their
changes.

if a draft version has been deleted. Clicking on the draft version shows the draft of the file, clicking on published shows the published version.
The "Delete" and "Download" buttons are available on the detail page for both published and draft files.

From the detail page of a file, the left hand panel displaying the file tree will show the Dataset that the viewed file belongs to—
draft or published. If the user visits a different version by selecting it in the revisions pane, the file tree will update to reflect
the current dataset.

To non-contributors, draft Dataverse files cannot be seen. If a dataset is completely unpublished, this means that the Dataverse add-on

Viewing figshare Files
***********
**Purpose:** The file tree and file details pages allow users to view and interact with figshare files.

figshare appears in in the file tree as an item in the component to which it has been added. It is on the same level as OSF Storage.
The tree identifies the project::

    figshare: [project title]

File names from a figshare project are shown in the file tree on the OSF—not the names assigned to them on figshare. Names of
both published, public files and private, draft files are shown in the tree. figshare files cannot be renamed. Folders cannot
be created within the figshare add-on.

If an OSF project is private and figshare is connected, a nondismissable blue alert is visible at the top of each page, regardless
of the privacy of the figshare files::

    Warning: This OSF component is private but figshare project 5022 may contain some public files or filesets.

If the OSF project is public, no alert is shown, regardless of the privacy of the figshare files. The titles of all figshare files are shown
in public projects.

If a figshare project is deleted from the figshare website, it no longer appears in the file tree, but is still visible as the
selected project on the project settings page.

When a user with admin or read+write permissions selects figshare in the file tree a “Upload” button appears. Clicking on “Upload”
opens a modal that allows you to select files from within your computer to upload. Admins and read+write contributors
can also drag and drop files onto the figshare add-on to upload a file. Uploading a file adds it to that
project on figshare as a draft.

If a new version of an already existent file is uploaded, two files with the exact same name will
appear in the add-on folder—they are not combined. Both these files will also appear in Figshare.

If a figshare file is selected by a user, a "View" button appears in the toolbar. Clicking this button or clicking the file title
brings the user to the details (rendering) page. Draft figshare files cannot be rendered. If the user clicks to render
a draft figshare file, in place of the rendered image is a blue alert::

    The file "[file name]" is still a draft on figshare.
    To view it on the OSF publish it on figshare.

No link is provided to view the file on figshare.

Public, published files on figshare are rendered on the OSF. Above the rendering is a link that reads::

    View this file on figshare.

Clicking this link sends the user to the figshare website.

When on the details page of a draft figshare file, no Download" button available. Users with editing permissions see a "Delete"
button on the details page of a draft file; clicking opens a confirmation modal::

    Delete file?
    Are you sure you want to delete [file name]?
    [Cancel][Delete]

Confirming the deletion brings the user to the file tree page where that file has been removed.

Public, published files cannot be deleted from the details page. A "Download" button is available.

If the user has editing privileges, clicking on a draft figshare file in the file tree shows a "Delete" button in the toolbar.
Clicking this button opens a modal::

    Delete "[file title]"?
    This action is irreversible.
    [Cancel][Delete]

If the user selects multiple draft files, a "Delete Multiple" button appears in the toolbar. Clicking opens a modal::

    Delete "[file title]"?
    This action is irreversible.

    [list of file titles]

    [Cancel][Delete]

After confirming, the files are removed from the OSF and figshare.

If the file is published, no "Delete" button is ever available from the file tree page. Two additional buttons
do show instead: "Download" and "View on figshare." Clicking "Download" will download a copy of the file.
Download counts are not available for figshare files. Clicking "View on figshare" will send the user to figshare
in that same browser window.

If multiple published files are selected, a "Download Multiple" button is available.

The user cannot select multiple published and draft files at once.

If the user attempts to move a draft file from figshare to OSF Storage, a red dismissable growlbox alert message will appear saying::

	Copy failed
	Cannot download private files.

The user receives an email as well::

    Hello,

    An error has occurred, and the file from [prject title] on The Open Science Framework was not successfully copied. Please
    log in and try this action again. If the problem persists, please email support@osf.io.

    The Open Science Framework Robot

Public, published figshare files can be copied to OSF storage. A copy of the file will be available in the figshare add-on and
the OSF Storage folders.

Files from other storage add-ons can be moved into figshare. These files are moved—not copied.

If the user moves a file with multiple versions into figshare, only the current version will be saved. All other versions will be lost.
Visiting the "revisions" view on a file's detail page shows a yellow alert in the revisions panel::

    figshare does not support file revisions.


Viewing GitHub Files
***********
**Purpose:** The file tree and file details pages allow users to view and interact with GitHub files.

GitHub appears in in the file tree as an item in the component to which it has been added. It is on the same level as OSF Storage.
The tree identifies the project::

    GitHub: [repo name] (branch)

File names from the indicated GitHub repo are shown in the file tree on the OSF.

Selecting the GitHub repo shows an "Open" button in the toolbar. Clicking sends the user to the GitHub website where the repo's
contents are shown.

A "Download" button appears when any user selects the GitHub repo. Clicking downloads the contents of the repo as a zip file.

A "Create Folder" button is shown when the add-on is selected by a user with editing permission. The user types a
folder name and confirms creation. The folder is then shown inside the GitHub add-on. Files can be moved into and out
of the folder. If moving a file fails, a red growlbox alert appears::

    Move failed.
    Please refresh the page or contact support@cos.io if the problem persists.

Depending on the error, a different alert may appear::

    Move failed.
    Update is not a fast forward

Even if an error is shown, refreshing the page may show the file has been successfully moved.

Folders cannot be deleted.

If a file from a folder in GitHub is moved elsewhere or a new file is uploaded to a location in GitHub where a file
of the same name exists, a modal appears::

    Replace "[file name]"?
    An item named "[file name]" already exists in this location.
    [Cancel][Keep Both][Replace]

Choosing "Replace" creates a new version of the file. Choosing "Keep Both" adds an integer to the end of the moved file's title
to indicate the difference.

When a user with editing permissions selects GitHub in the file tree, an “Upload” button appears. Clicking on “Upload”
opens a modal that allows you to select files from within your computer to upload. Admins and read+write contributors
can also drag and drop files onto the GitHub add-on to upload a file. If a new version of an already existent file is
uploaded, the new version will replace the existing one.

Selecting the GitHub add-on also shows a "Branch:" dropdown. The dropdown lists all existing branches of the repo. It is visible
even if only one branch is available.

Selecting a file from the file tree shows a "Download" button in the toolbar.  No "Download Multiple" button
is ever available, even if multiple GitHub files are selected. Download counts are not available for GitHub.

If the user has editing privileges, clicking on a GitHub file in the file tree shows a "Delete" button in the toolbar.
Clicking this button opens a modal::

    Delete "[file title]"
    This action is irreversible.
    [Cancel][Delete]

After confirming, the file is removed from the OSF and GitHub.

Files from other storage add-ons cannot be moved into GitHub. Files from GitHub can be copied into other add-ons by dragging
and dropping, however.

Users with editing permissions can select a GitHub file to rename it. Clicking the "Rename" button that appears in the file
tree's toolbar opens a text box where the new name can be entered and saved.

If the connected repo is public, any user can select a file and see the "View on GitHub" button in the toolbar. Clicking
sends the user to the GitHub website where the file is displayed. If the repo is private, neither contributors nor visitors
see this button.

If a GitHub file is selected by a user, a "View" button appears in the toolbar. Clicking this button or clicking the file title
brings the user to the details (rendering) page where the file is rendered. No link is provided to view the file on GitHub. The file detail page will show the branch on the left hand file navigation bar. 

No actions can be performed if the user selects multiple files.

On the file's detail page, the image is rendered in the default "view" pane. Users with editing permissions see a "Delete"
button in the top right.

    Delete file?
    Are you sure you want to delete [file name]?
    [Cancel][Delete]

Confirming the deletion brings the user to the file tree page where that file has been removed.

A blue "Download" button is also available on the detail page. Clicking downloads the file.

Text and code files can be edited from the file detail page by users with edit permissions. Clicking "Edit" opens a pane
to the right of the rendered text where the user can revise the contents of the file. Saving updates the contents of the file.
No formatting options are available.

Selecting the "Revisions" button on the detail page opens the revisions pane. All commited versions of the file are listed.
The version ID, the date of the commit, and the user name of the editor is available. A download button is shown on the
right side of the pane.

All changes to GitHub via the OSF are logged as individual commits.

If a private repo is connected to a private project that is then made public, a warning appears in the confirmation modal
for making the project public::

    This component is connected to a private GitHub repository. Users (other than contributors) will not be able to see
    the contents of this repo unless it is made public on GitHub.

When the user confirms, contributors see a non-dismissable blue alert at the top of the page::

    Warning: This OSF component is public, but the GitHub repo [repo name] is private. Users can
    view the contents of this private GitHub repository through this public project.

If the GitHub repo connected is public, but the OSF project is private, a blue non-dismissable alert is visible at the top
of the page for all contributors::

    Warning: This OSF component is private, but the GitHub repo [repo name] is public. The files in this GitHub repo can
    be viewed on GitHub here.

Viewing Google Drive Files

Viewing External Link
******
**Purpose:** Users can connect a project to an external link. They are prompted to redirect to this link upon entering the OSF project. 

 Once this add-on is configured, visitors to the project will immediately receive a window that reads::

    This project contains a forward to URL
    [Cancel] [Redirect]

Canceling will cause the user to enter the OSF project. Clicking the link or "Redirect" will replace the current tab with the external link. 

Viewing Mendeley Content
******
**Purpose:** Users can share their citations associated with a project using Mendeley.

From a project's :ref:`overview page <overview>`, Mendeley content can be viewed in a panel below the file tree. The panel is
titled "Mendeley."

At the top of the panel is a dropdown with placeholder text::
    Citation STyle (e.g."APA")

Below this are the citations that the user who connected the add-on has stored in the linked folder. Citations are listed in a table.
Below the "Citation" column is the citation for each resource, formatted according to the style selected in the dropdown.
In the "Actions" column there is a paper icon. Hovering over the icon shows a tooltip that reads "Copy Citation." Clicking the paper icon
copies the citation to the user's clipboard.

Users can change the citation style from the default APA by clicking in the dropdown and beginning to type a citation style. Suggestions
based on the input will appear as items in the dropdown. If the user selects one, the citations in the Citation column are
reformatted accordingly.

Viewing OSF Storage Files
******
**Purpose**: OSF Storage allows users to store and share files. 

Users can obtain and distribute links for their documents in public projects on the OSF so others can then view the same rendered files. In addition, users are provided two different methods of embedding those documents, one in which the iFrame is dynamically rendered and another which provides the iFrame directly.

On the *file details* page, the user sees buttons across the top right::

    Delete
    Share
    Download
    View
    Revisions

The user clicks the Share button and a popover appears with two tabs::
    Share
    Embed

The Share Tab provides a URL and a button to copy the URL to the user's clipboard.
The Embed Tab provides two entries::
    Dynamically Render iFrame with JavaScript (with the associated javascript in a box below)
    Direct iFrame with Fixed Height and Width (with the assocated HTML in a box below)
